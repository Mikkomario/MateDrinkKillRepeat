There's no sure-fire way to win, but here's a few tips:

First, it might be a good idea to hide the body once or twice.

Go to the tables, as that's where the closest bartender is. Buy drinks and drink a little to reduce your stress.

Try talking to customers to find out their names. Giving them drinks will intoxicate them and make planting
evidence easier. The police will waste some time interrogating them.

It's good to use your cloth while you still have both the cloth and the knife in your inventory:
this will make the knife harder to find if you hide it!

You really lose only if the police catch you carrying evidence, or if they find all the evidence and come to
interrogate you.

The Balcony is a good spot for hiding yourself or evidence: the police move randomly, and there's only one
entrance to the balcony.

The cops can also go in shock or pass out!
