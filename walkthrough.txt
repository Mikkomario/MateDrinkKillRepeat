There's no sure-fire way to win as there's many random elements in this game, but here's a few tips:

First, it might be a good idea to hide the body once or twice. Three times is already cheating. ;)

Go to the tables, as that's where the closest bartender is. Buy drinks and drink a little to reduce your stress.

Try talking to customers to find out their names. Giving them drinks will intoxicate them and make planting
evidence easier, and also make them seem more suspicious. The police will waste some time interrogating them.

It's good to use your cloth while you still have both the cloth and the knife in your inventory:
this will clean the knife, making it harder to find if you hide it!

You really only lose if the police catch you carrying evidence, or if they find all the evidence and come to
interrogate you.

The Balcony is a good spot for hiding yourself or evidence: the police move randomly, and there's only one
entrance to the balcony.

The cops can also go in shock or pass out!
