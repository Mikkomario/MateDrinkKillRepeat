The object of the game is to not have evidence once at least 25 turns have passed.
Don't get caught by the police! The more drunk and stressed out you are, the more suspicious you will look.
The police will be called when someone notices any evidence.
Drinking relieves stress, but makes actions harder. Carrying evidence stresses you out slowly.

If you pass out or go into shock (results of excessive alcohol and stress, respectively), you lose.
